When someone is hired for a job, there are a number of formalities to take care of before they begin their first day as a new employee with the company. There are tax forms, employee guidelines, a handbook, and packages explaining benefits that need to be reviewed.


## Handbook
An employee handbook is a compilation of the policies, procedures, working conditions, and behavioral expectations that guide employee actions in a particular workplace.

Employee handbooks generally include information about the company, a welcome letter from the president or CEO, the company's mission, vision, purpose, values, and broad strategic goals, the company's commitment to employees, and various non-compete, non-disclosure, and employee confidentiality agreements, if the company uses them.


They also use handbooks to describe working conditions and the workplace behavior and contributions they expect from employees.


They protect themselves from lawsuits, such as harassment claims, wrongful termination claims, and discrimination claims. Employee handbooks generally contain a code of conduct for employees that sets guidelines around appropriate behavior for the individual workplace.

A majority of employers ask employees to sign a statement to demonstrate that the employee has read the employee handbook and agrees to abide by the contents.
